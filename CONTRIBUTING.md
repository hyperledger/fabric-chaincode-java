# Contributing to fabric-chaincode-java

We welcome contributions to the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io) Project. There's always plenty to do!

If you have any questions about the project or how to contribute, you can find us in the [fabric-java-chaincode](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-java-chaincode) Hyperledger Rocket.Chat channel.

Here are a few guidelines to help you contribute successfully...

## Issues

We currently track bug reports using the [Hyperledger JIRA](https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+FAB+AND+component+%3D+fabric-chaincode-java) tool.

If you find a bug which we don't already know about, you can help us by creating a new issue describing the problem. Please include as much detail as possible to help us track down the cause.

> **Note:** Please use Rocket.Chat instead of JIRA to ask questions.

## Fixes

If you want to begin contributing code, looking through our open issues is a good way to start. Try looking for recent issues with detailed descriptions first, or ask us on Rocket.Chat if you're unsure which issue to choose.

## Enhancements

Make sure you have the support of the Hyperledger Fabric community before investing a lot of effort in project enhancements. For example, discuss your proposal on Rocket.Chat or open a JIRA issue for feedback before starting work.

> **Note:** A more formal RFC process is under development for Hyperledger Fabric enhancement requests.

## Pull Requests

We use our own forks and [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to deliver changes to the code. Follow these steps to deliver your first pull request:

1. [Fork the repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) and create a new branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. If you've added any new features or made breaking changes, update the documentation.
4. Ensure all the tests pass.
5. Include the JIRA issue number, a descriptive message, and the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works) on all commit messages.
6. [Issue a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request)!
7. [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/Fabric-Chaincode-Java) builds must succeed before the pull request can be reviewed and merged.
