/**
 * <p>
 * Supports collection of metrics
 * <p>
 * The main metrics that are available are the statistics around the number of tasks that are
 * running, and how the thread pool is handling these.
 * 
 * Note a 'task' is a message from the Peer to the Chaincode - this message is either
 * a new transaction, or a response from a stub API, eg getState().  Query apis
 * may return more than one response. 
 * 
 * To enable metrics ensure that there is a standard format Java properites file called `config.props`
 * in the root of your contract code. For example this path <pre>myjava-contract-project/java/src/main/resources/config.props</pre>
 * 
 * This should contain the following
 * 
 * <pre>
 * CHAINCODE_METRICS_ENABLED=true
 * TP_CORE_POOL_SIZE=5
 * TP_MAX_POOL_SIZE=5
 * TP_QUEUE_SIZE=5000
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The metrics enabled flag will turn on default metrics logging. (it's off by default)
 * The TP values establish the core thread pool size, max thread poolsize, and the number of 
 * of tasks that will wait. (5, 5, 5000 are the default values, so don't need to be explicitly
 * specified).
 * 
 * If no file is supplied mertics are not enabled, the values shown for the thread pool are used.
