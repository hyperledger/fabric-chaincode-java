    <p>This is the project to support the writing of Contracts with the JVM runtime - enabling development of using Java language or other JVM based languages</p>

    <p>The Fabric programming model is described in the <a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/developapps/developing_applications.html">Developing Applications</a> chapter of the Hyperledger Fabric documentation.</p>

    <p>All Contracts should implement {@link org.hyperledger.fabric.contract.ContractInterface} interface, in addition to the {@link org.hyperledger.fabric.contract.annotation.Contract} annotation.</p>
